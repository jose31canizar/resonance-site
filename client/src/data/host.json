      "Food, body, and love are three areas of my life that have been a huge source of frustration and pain. As a sensitive and intuitive woman with a difficult childhood, food become my ally. It was my emotional support that was always there for me. It wasn't until college that things got really out of control and messy. Food (and myself) became my greatest enemy.",
      "Now over 10 years fully committed to healing, my food challenges are a thing of the past. I finally figured out what a normal relationship to food feels like. It’s everything I imagined it would be like. Liberating. Enjoyable. Uncomplicated.",
      "I fell down a lot. I got back up a lot. It was by no means an overnight success. However, there was information that would've greatly helped me get to where I wanted to be faster. That’s the reason this rally exists for you. To save you time and countless shame hangovers. Wherever you are at, I know you can get better. ESPECIALLY when you let the advice from the experts in this rally sink in.",
      "I’m dedicated to getting this information out there in a big way. In a few short years, I’ve built a top-ranked meal and emotion tracking app called Rise Up and an online resource hub for food and body issues that's been used over 8 million times in 184 countries. I’ve helped thousands and thousands of people get to a place where food is no longer controlling their lives. Where they can confidently strut down the aisle in their wedding dress regardless of size. Or courageously make bold moves in their career and relationships because they stopped letting their weight hold them back. Join me for this inspiring and educational week and see what changes will happen in your life."
