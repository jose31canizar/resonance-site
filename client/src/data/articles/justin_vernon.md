##The Transcendent Genius of Justin Vernon

<span>**10 years ago**,</span> in the “good winter” of 2008, a man sat in a cabin in the north woods of Wisconsin writing what would become the defining album of indie-folk.  Much like the setting in which it was written, the album was simultaneously and cohesively sparse, haunting and beautiful.  Melodies that hardly seemed real danced with a voice that sounded equally parts feeble and authoritative.  That album was For Emma, Forever Ago, the band was Bon Iver, and the man was Justin Vernon.

<br/>
Since the release of For Emma, Justin Vernon and Bon Iver have progressively added to their sound and expanded their influence on music in the 21st century.  The release of the Blood Bank EP in 2009 and the self-titled album Bon Iver in 2011 cemented the project’s brilliance, a brilliance that was eventually noticed by Kanye West.  West harnessed Vernon’s talents on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus.  Collaborations with West and projects with British “post-dub” artist James Blake not only expanded Vernon’s status in the broader music industry, but deepened his own philosophy and style as an artist.

Vernon embodied this shift in style with the release of 22, A Million in September 2016.  The isolated aesthetic of Bon Iver’s first two albums was abandoned as acoustic and folk melodies and instrumentals transformed into electronically experimental soundscapes.  The result was a universally acclaimed album that embraced uncertainty and discomfort.  Its songs are “_fluttery and skeletal…struggling against known trajectories,_” Amanda Petrusich wrote in Pitchfork’s review of the album that year.  22, A Million doesn’t rest on the commercial and critical success of Vernon’s previous Bon Iver releases.  It takes their deepest emotion and longing and explodes it into a discordant chorus of digital, acoustic, auto-tuned, symbolic wholeness.

At the heart of Vernon’s compositions is deep appreciation for life and the moments of incomprehensibility and heartbreak that only it can provide.  He often says that music and art cannot be forced or coaxed out of artificial experience.  There must be a harnessing of creative energy and inspirations.  Many listeners wondered if that energy would ever be harnessed again after the success of 2011’s Bon Iver. Vernon himself said he wasn’t sure.  Incredibly, it was captured and transformed into something altogether different sonically, yet fundamentally Bon Ivorian (_you heard it here first?_) thematically.
